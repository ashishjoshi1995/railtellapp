        android:text="India&apos;s agriculture is statistically the widest economic sector, which forms the basis of largest employment source and a major section of the overall social expansion. For high agricultural productivity the agriculture practices need to be implemented which could be only performed by proper agriculture/crop monitoring. For this purpose Satellite Based Agriculture Information System (SBAIS) has been developed. SBAIS is the India&apos;s first satellite data based online information system for agriculture/crop monitoring at district and tehsil level in Uttarakhand state. The system is based on the analysis of multi-temporal satellite data and composed of mainly two modules namely &quot;Classification&quot; and &quot;Crop Monitoring&quot;.  In classification module, the location of greenness/vegetation could be identified, as the agricultural area is segregated from other land cover classes. Through this module in addition to the agricultural region identification, the change in the area of the greenness from the previous year till the selected year could also be estimated which discovers the variations in the vegetation area within a time period.  The Crop Monitoring module is based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is a measure of plant/crop “greenness” based on the photosynthetic process or chlorophyll content and hence identifies the crop health. For crop health monitoring two options are available, one is Julian date wise and another is year wise. In julian date wise option the season wise effect on the crop health could be monitored and also the alterations occurred in crop health in a specific time period could be observed. Through year wise option, along with vegetative state (healthy/normal/weak) estimation for all the respective years, the year wise fluctuations between the selected years in the vegetation physical conditions could also be identified."
